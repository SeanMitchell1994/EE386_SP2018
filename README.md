# EE386_SP2018
Satellite Dish Stablization Project for UAH EE 386 SP2018

## Description
This project focused on the simulation of a rocket in vertical flight. The goal of this simulation was to determine the flight dynamics and use those to derive a stable model for the vertical flight of the  rocket. Done in MATLAB, the simulation modeled the dynamics of the unstable system along with  various methods to control the system. These methods included P, PD, and PID controllers. Using this simulation, a comparison of the controllers and their performance was performed to find the best way to control the system.
